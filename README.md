Hack-A-Damien Game Project
Background
This game project was developed during the inaugural Hack-A-Damien, a 24-hour game development hackathon hosted at the University of Albany. Sponsored by IBM, the UAlbany College of Nanotechnology, Science, and Engineering, and Grimbar Interactive, the hackathon encourages students from various colleges and universities to test their game development skills in a collaborative, high-energy environment.

Game Overview
Inspired by the simple yet addictive Google Chrome Dino game, this project introduces enhanced gameplay mechanics, including double jumps and strategic platform elements. Players navigate a character through a scrolling landscape, using double jumps to avoid obstacles and reach platforms that contain doggy treats or bones, which serve to increase the player's score.

Features
Double Jump Mechanics: Allows the player to perform a double jump to reach higher platforms or avoid oncoming obstacles.
Scoring System: Collect doggy treats or bones to increase your score, adding a layer of strategy as players decide which platforms to target based on potential rewards.
Dynamic Obstacles: The game includes various obstacles that challenge the player's timing and jumping skills.
